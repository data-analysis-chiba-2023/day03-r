# DAY 3 HOMEWORK
#
# Name:
#
# 1. What are the values after each statement in the following?
#
# Type in the value after the comment, like this:
# mass = 40
# (I have done the first one for you)

mass <- 160                # mass = 160
height <- 6                # height =
mass <- mass / 2           # mass =
height <- height * 30      # height =
bmi <- height / mass       # bmi =

# 2. The following code has an error. Fix it by editing the code:

weight_lb <- 160
weight_kg <- weight_Lb / 2.2

# 3. What is the value of z after running the following code?
x <- 2
y <- 3
z <- x + y
x <- 5



# 4. The sqrt() function calculates the square root of a number.
# Use the sqrt() function to calculate the square root of 25.



# 5. The seq() function generates sequences of numbers.
# Its arguments include "from" (the starting number), "to"
# (the ending number), and "by" (how much to add
# between each number)
#
# Use seq() make the following sequence of numbers:
# 2, 4, 6, 8, 10



# 6. Make a vector of logical values (TRUE and FALSE), then make vector of
# character values. Next, combine the two vectors. What is the type of
# vector that you obtain?
#
# HINT: use c() to make vectors
# HINT: characters are always written with quotation marks




# 7. R includes some pre-defined vectors, like `letters`:
letters

# Use subsetting and the seq() function to subset every other letter starting
# with "a"
#
# HINT: Use `seq()` inside the square brackets
